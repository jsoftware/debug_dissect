NB. TODO
NB. Should put 'atom' as shape of selection when it is shown filled with ()?
NB. u :. v doesn't allow getting into u with right-click
NB. (,.4 3) toupper;.0 'abracadabra'  should highlight the implied selection from the ;.0?
NB. dissect '25{.(,.~ <@>:@i.@#) ;({."#. <@(0&#`({.@{.(;,)<@}."1)@.(1<#))/. ])/:~~.,/(+,/:~@,)"0/~3^~1+i.100'   slow
NB. Put type of value into highlight line
NB. 
NB. Must add both other penalties when taking a turn? - no
NB. Adj penalties can cause a long route where a spread would help.  But where to localize the spread?
NB. Think more about grayed-out words in the sentence
NB. Have a way to do selections from script, for testing

NB. ?work on Android, with wd 'activity'

NB. (1) 3&+&2 (5 6 7)  shows ^: in the stack.  Change the 1 and see duplicates too - if details enabled
NB.     going to leave the ^:1 in to show what happened.  Change ^: in stack to (^:)?
NB. fit value needs to be evaluated in its locale to get the value right (needed by /.) - if nonsdt, should come in on the right
NB. Enforce a recursion limit to help debug stack error - if original failed w/stack error?
NB. support u . v y
NB. support {::
NB. Add rank-calculus for primitives with known behavior?

NB. dissect - 2d graphical single-sentence debugger

NB. the call is:
NB. [options] dissect [sentence]
NB. where sentence is a string to be executed.  The sentence is parsed and modified so that every verb execution creates
NB. logging information about its input and outputs.  Then the modified sentence is executed (in the same context as the original
NB. dissect verb), and then the results are displayed in 2d form.  If sentence is omitted, the sentence from the last error is used.
NB.
NB. Options are (bitmask)[;(label options)] where
NB.  bit 0 is 1 to use a sandbox for executing the sentence
NB.  bit 1 is 1 to return the locale of the dissect window
NB.  bit 2 is 1 to suppress assignment statements.  They will not be executed and an error will result if an assigned name is referred to later.
NB.  bit 3 is 1 if this call was from the J debugger.  It changes the error messages if the assignments rule is violated.
NB.
NB. Label options are a table of (type);(string) where types are
NB.  'title'  string is (fontchange)TABtitle  fontchange is +-amount to increase over sentence size, title is text
NB.  'link'  string is (fontchange)TABdisplay textTABlink text
NB.  'datasize'  string is vpct hpct   max size of noun, in % of screen (must be converted to numeric)
NB.  'check'  string is 'all'=full comparison, shape'=shape and type only; 'error'=success/failure only; 'no'=no comparison (and don't execute the original sentence)
NB.
NB. If y is boxed, it should be a table ready for use in parse, i. e. nx3 where the first line gives
NB. options;locale;text of sentence
NB. and the remaining lines are the local names defined in the running explicit definition, as described in z458095869 below
NB.
NB. Result is a string containing an error message if a window couldn't be created, otherwise an empty string EXCEPT when the

NB. Here to execute a modifier.  We do that when we encounter a modified verb.
NB. This will be from VN A or VN C VN, but the A in VN A might be a compound adverb.
NB. We detect that if the adverb's value is boxed rather than a string.  In that case we
NB. recur on the parts of the adverb.
NB. y is the exeblock.
NB. Result is a line to put on the stack, coming from the execution of the modifier
execmod =: 3 : 0
exeblock =. y
NB. If the modifier's value is boxed, it is a compound modifier, necessarily bident.  We will classify it as
NB. C VN, VN C, or A A, and execute it as is appropriate.

  NB. We have guaranteed that every modifier line of modblock has been executed, but any tokens in the second
  NB. line of exeblock have not been assigned to any modifier.  These must be parentheses that wrapped the compound
  NB. modifier.  We will assign them to the top-level modifier that we just created.

  NB. when the sentence is traversed

Dissect's result from running the sentence did not match the result from running the sentence in the J session.  There are 3 possible reasons:

1. Your sentence is irreproducible, because it uses random numbers (the ? verb) or inconstant external data, or it has side effects.

2. The J interpreter has a bug executing your code that does not show up when executing Dissect's sentence, which is slightly different.

3. Dissect has a bug.

Do you want Dissect to display its result anyway?

to scroll the display, click-and-hold in an empty area, then move the mouse.
click-and-hold on a wire to highlight its entire network.
hover over a word in the sentence at the top of the screen to highlight its block.
click on a word in the sentence at the top of the screen to focus on its block.
you can choose how big the data blocks are with the Sizes menu.
use the Config menu to save the current settings as defaults for future executions of dissect.
when a block has a bottom-right resize handle, drag the handle to resize the block.
if the data won't fit in a block, you can right-click on the data to get a fullscreen window on the data.
to look inside a named verb, select a single result-cell and right-click the name.*You will get a new window (either dissect or debug).
if a block shows no results, you might need to select a single result-cell of a later verb.
when a display block contains the results of more than one verb*(as in +"1"2 which displays results of +"2, +"1, and +),*you may click more than once to select a result-cell of successive verbs.
the arguments contributing to a selection are outlined in the same color as the selection.
the word producing a selection is color-coded in the sentence.
the smallest selected cell is indicated with a heavy outline.
] and [ are not normally shown, but you can change that in the Preferences menu.
the << < > buttons allow you to undo and redo selections.
the shape of a result is shown just above the values.
the shape of the result-cells of a verb is shown in purple in the shape line.
the frame of the result is shown in the shape line before the purple result-cell shape.*The frame is color-coded as selections are made.
an empty result-cell is shown as a gray rectangle.
a value with leading 1 in the shape is shown in italics.*Examples: a one-atom list; an array with shape 1 4
when you make a selection, the path to the selection is shown below the shape.
a parenthesized value at the end of the shape indicates the presence of framing fill.
atoms added by framing fill are crosshatched.
the cell where an error occurred is doubly crosshatched.
the numbers to the side(s) of verb-names are the rank(s) of the cells the verb was applied to.
if the message displayed by a click is too small, click again for a bigger display.
use the Preferences menu to set the font and sizes for display components.
when a block is outlined in red, it means not all the data fit into the display.
if your sentence has an error, dissect automatically selects to the point of error.
if you have clicked in the dissection of a sentence with error, the << button will reset selections to the point of error.
you can set a PF key to dissect a sentence from a script or session log.
you can set the debugger to dissect sentences automatically when you stop on them.
dissect ignores control words, so you can dissect 'if. condition do.' as is. 
hidden computation, such as in u/, u^:n, or u1`u2@v, can be seen by clicking in the result*to create an expansion block that shows the hidden computation.
results of different executions in an expansion block are each boxed so they can be collected into a single value. 
> in the shape or selection line indicates that an additional level of boxing has been added for display purposes.
when a value has more than 2 axes, they alternate horizontal and vertical directions.*Blue lines in the data separate cells of rank 2 and up.
when the cursor is over a value, the status line (above the main display) shows the index list and boxing path to the atom under the cursor.
left-click on a word in the block titles to see the NuVoc page for it.
right-click on the shape of a block (above the data) to copy the data to the clipboard.
when a cell is selected, right-click in the selection line (below the shape) to copy the cell to the clipboard.
buy low; sell high.

NB. It turns out that having multiple selections active is confusing, even if they are for different
NB. monad/dyad execs.  So, show selections only for the last selection at each level (and delete any that are out of order)
NB. Selections are either up (added a value to selections), down (took away a value), or sideways (changed a value
NB. without changing the count).  Down happens only when an expansion is being rescinded.  Our challenge is to make sure
NB. we include, in addition to the final operation at each level, a previous up if that up installed an initialselection
NB. into a preselection node, because that state is used as a flag to indicate that the expansion should be created.
NB. We note that sideways operations are always reselections of a previously-selected node.  We will discard everything up to (but not
NB. including, though it doesn't matter) the last down; then we will take the last up; then we will take the last sideways following the last up.  The sideways
NB. must be in the path selected by the up, so that fact that the up is overridden by the sideways causes no trouble.
NB.
NB. After we have picked the actions for each level, we discard any actions for a level n if lower lavels have a later action.
NB. This cannot cause trouble, because it is impossible for a lower level to have an action between an up and a sideways of a leter level.

NB. Selection calculation for traversedown
NB. If there are input selectors, we see if this node qualifies the input still
NB. further.  We calculate the level to be used for the next selection (which is incremented from
NB. the current level if this level makes a selection), and the new selection, including the
NB. selected operands and the selected result.  We leave a lot of stuff lying around in globals for
NB. use by creategridobj; what we return is the selector we use at this node (if any) and a flag
NB. indicating whether the result of that selection is a singleton (which means we can collect it)
NB.
NB. If snifferror__COCREATOR is 1, it means we are doing the initial selection to find where the crash was.  We
NB. set this value to 2 after we have encountered the error, so that we catch only the first error.  We catch framing errors
NB. before execution errors; otherwise we follow the J order
NB. When there is a selection, we always select the last thing that happened.
NB. y is a single list with 0-4 items depending on selection status.  When operands are given, it is implied that
NB. the selector is selecting a single application of the verb.
NB.
NB. The global   selections  is maintained by the selection system, and indicates click status.  The value holds the entire selection path from
NB.  the base selector.  If there is a selection at this level (i. e #selection is > sellevel), then sellevel{selections
NB.  if the selector to use here
NB.
NB. Object globals set here are:
NB. sellevel - the selection level of this node.  Incremented when there is a selection.  Gives the number of previous selections
NB. physreqandhighlights - the physical selections corresponding to the selections for each operand.  This is filled in here during traversal.
NB.  Boxed list, with one table per operand.  Each row has
NB. (*#frame)+sellevel entries when well-formed.  Each entry in first row is a box containing a table of index lists (all
NB.  necessarily of the same rank); each entry in second row holds a cell to be highlighted for that operand; third row gives the
NB.  sellevel at the time the entry was added
NB. frame - the frame of the verb.
NB. frames - the individual franes, boxed
NB. selframe - the frame for selection purposes.  Normally the same as frame, but some compounds which have
NB.  infinite rank actually produce results in sections that need to be selected.  Examples are u^:v, u;.n etc
NB. errorcode - An indication of the result of applying the selection to the results of the verb, and comparing it to the
NB.  frame of the operands.  Values > 0 indicate error, 0=OK, _1=unknown because no operands; _2=unknown because no selector.
NB.  The errorcode gives the status of the input values passed to this verb, BEFORE any local selector is applied.
NB.  Values: _2,_1=unknown 0=OK others below.
NB.  UNEXECD=some cells ran, but not all, but no error NOEXECD=no cells ran
NB.  ABORTED=no cells ran, and error was detected EXEC=cells ran, but one failed
NB.  Values EOK and below are terminals; they should not be replaced.  Values above EOK indicate
NB.  incomplete results; the lower a value, the more precise it is, so we will replace higher values
NB.  with a lower during inheritu.

ENOTERROR =: ENOUN,EOK,ENOEXECD,EUNEXECD,ENOOPS,ENOSEL
NB. selresult - the result of applying the selection to the result of the verb.  This is the selection based on the INPUT to
NB.   this verb, not including any local selector, which is used for subnodes (the local selector is used for selector and selopinfo)
NB.   Since the selected result might not collect properly, we leave it
NB.   with each item boxed.  This is the raw selected result, always a boxed list.  It is used only for display, and needs
NB.   to be shaped using the frame before it is opened.
NB. selresultshape - the shape that selresult will have if it collects properly.  Passed on as the input to the next verb
NB. selector - the selector to use for subnodes of the current node, created by applying the local selector to the selector
NB.  given in the input arguments.  If there is an early error (agreement), or if the local selector gives an error,
NB.  the selector is an empty list, which will suppress further analysis.  If the selector contains multiple ranges, we assume that
NB.  we are just waiting for a final collection
NB. selopshape - The shape of the selected operand: the (remaining shape).  These come in from the y input, representing the state before this level, and go out
NB.  with the state after going through the local selection.  The operand shape is inferred from the rank of
NB.   the verb, so is valid even when there is no selector.  List of boxes, one per operand.
NB. selopinfovalid - set if there is no frame, or if there is a local selection.  List, one per operand.  This indicates that a single operand cell
NB.   has been selected, and can therefore be used by a subsequent v verb.
NB. errorlevel - a derivative of *#errorlevel__COCREATOR at the time this is parsed; 0 = nothing, 1 = fill-cell, 2 = adverse.
NB.  When it comes time to display error info, we don't use the result failure type for anything except
NB.  top-level errors
NB. opselin - the operand selections made on the current node.  This is initialized to empty here, and added onto whenever a layout is drawn
NB. vranks - the rank(s) of the operand. 1 or 2 numbers, but empty for a noun or for a verb that didn't execute
NB. rankhistory - 1{y holds the table of previous ranks.  We append vranks to it, to produce the rank stack for this operand.  The format of the rank stack is
NB.  (string form of name to display);(locale (NOT boxed));(rank r)[;(rank l).  The rank is the effective rank rather than actual: the rank of the cells
NB.  that the verb actually applies to.  This depends on the rank of the argument.
NB.  If the string form is instead 0, it means that this rankhistory is a 'heavy' locale marker that should always float down to u operands
NB. resultlevel - indicates boxing of result: '' = none, normal; 0 = result replaces ops in hierarchy (L:); 1 = box is added (&.> or expansion); 2=collection error
NB. nvalidresults - the number of valid selresults when we started this node.  We have to calculate this here, because inheritance of an error cell into a higher result may add a selresult, and we need
NB.  to make sure we don't try to select one beyond THAT cell.

NB. Calculate the detours required around blocks that cover the target.  We only worry about blocks
NB. that overlap the target, because the route tends to get stuck aiming for a position that is blocked off the target
NB. Work on blocks that block east-west
NB. We could include cells block by earlier routes here, if we want to
NB. Starting at the target row, scan up & down: first clear cells following a gap;
NB. then total to leave the number of detours for each cell.  This gives two sections, one above (& including) the
NB. target, one including & below.  Expand each of these to the full grid size by repeating the row for the
NB. target
NB. We take advantage of the fact that we have cleared occupancy in the target cell, in the target direction.
NB. This will guarantee that we do not detect detours in the target cell

NB. Propagate that value left-to-right away from the target, to get #detours for west-east runs
NB. This is a brick with two layers: (# detours going North, # going South)
detour =. (>./\."1 tgx {."1 detour) ,"1 (>./\"1 tgx }."1 detour)
NB. Combine them with the turn penalties for each direction and take the lower value, to give
NB. the total # of turn-penalties at each position
NB. (Note: this does not take into account a possible jog-move at the end of the block.  Probably not
NB. material, since such a move would incur neighbor penalties; but if we want to handle it, we would reduce
NB. the penalty for cells that have a detour count of 1, in the direction of the target only)
NB. There are different rules for left-of-target and right-of-target, and for each
NB. source direction.  Fetch the combining rules, one for left and one for right, for each
NB. source direction (which is how the result table will be indexed).
NB. Expand rules to one value for left and one for right.  It doesn't matter what happens
NB. at the exact target x, because the target cell is empty and therefore has no blockages in its column
NB. Each detour will count twice; but if 0, use a low-value to remove all penalty
NB. Note: some of the penalties were calculated in the table as calling for detour-2; for those we should add back
NB.  2 detours if detour is actually 1; but it's not worth doing, and anyway no crime to underestimate the possible distance.
NB.  It tends to self-correct anyway, as such a run would turn immediately, to a position that has the correct value

NB.   each containing a selector for that frame.  The list of selectors may be shorter than the list of allframes,
NB.   in which case lower selectors are omitted.
NB. y is information about formatting (font size for the data)
NB. result is the layout, saved in globals in the locale
NB.  valueformat is shape;y endpixels;x endpixels[;array of boxed subnouns, with shape of the boxed noun, each box containing a DOL]
NB.   y endpixels is the ending position of each row in the display.  The number of atoms will be */ (even items of shape, counting from the end)
NB.    a gap of 1 pixel is left between blocks of rank 3, 5, etc.  This is included in the y endpixels values
NB.   x endpixels is similar for x
NB.   subnouns is provided only for boxed selresult.  It gives the valueformat for each box of the represented part of selresult.

NB. The monad is what is called externally.  It uses the top-level values saved in the locale
NB. Create the data for the selresult.  We have to try to collect it, because the verb may have encountered
NB. an error before we tried to collect it, possibly leaving an uncollectable result (i. e. it would have
NB. had a framing error if it survived long enough to collect).  If collection succeeds, we use the
NB. collected value; if not, we box the atoms, collect that, and use it.  When we come to display
NB. the uncollectable value we will suppress the outer boxing in the display.
NB. If collection succeeds, we fill out an incomplete execution with fills of the appropriate type;
NB. if collection fails, we fill with spaces (OK since the values are boxed immediately, and we don't want
NB. the fills to have text)

SFOPEN =: <,'>'  NB. This element in a CSF or ISF means 'drop down a level'
NB. The highlight system puts highlights into canonical selection form.
NB. standard selection form is a box containing a list of boxes
NB. Each box contains a list of boxes, where each nonempty box specifies
NB. selection and each SFOPEN specifies dropping down a boxing level.

NB. y is a box containing selectors, or SFOPEN
NB. Result is 0 if it contains unboxed selectors,
NB. _1 if it is SFOPEN, 1 if boxed selectors
classsel =: <:@L.`_1:@.(-:&SFOPEN)"0

NB. y is an ISF, a box which contains either an array of axes of a list of boxes with selections.
NB. We convert any level-1 boxes (containing the array of selections) to level 2, by converting each
NB. list to a list of 1 boxed atom.  We are careful to make sure that any boxed ISF is a list at least.
isftorank2 =: ,^:(''-:$)@(,@<"1^:(0=L.))&.>
NB. y is ISF, which convert to level 3 by boxing any level-2 contents.  Result is in one-box-per-axis form
isftolevel3 =: <"0&.>^:(0=classsel)"0&.>@isftorank2
NB. y is a rank-2 ISF.  Make sure it starts with a selection, by prepending a null selection if it starts with SFOPEN
isfensureselection =: (<0$0)&,^:(SFOPEN={.)&.>

NB. selections themselves are in initial selection form, which is like CSF without the outer box,
NB. and also allows the contents of a box to be a (nonempty) list which specifies selection only.
NB. Unboxed contents should be combined together and merged into the first nonempty box of the
NB. next boxed contents.
NB. ISF works because it is impossible to have a selection that drops down a boxing level and then
NB. does a selection without going down a level (in other words, ends with a selection-only).
NB. y is list of ISFs, result is boxed CSF
NB. First bring any rank-1 contents to ranks 2.  Then cut on SFOPEN, combining all boxes found between them.
NB. If there are no boxes between SFOPEN, don't create one (that would change the boxing levels)
isftocsf =: ;@:(<@(3 : 0)"1)
NB. Bring the list of ISFs up to level 3, where each box contains selections from one axis
NB. Collect all the selections at the same boxing level into one list.  This produces a sequence
NB. of boxes containing lists of boxes, one per axis, interspersed with SFOPENs
NB. Remove empties, which select nothing.  They have been needed till now to distinguish highlighting
NB. a scalar (which selects nothing) from no highlight at all.  But here we know we have a highlight
if. #highlightblocks =. a: -.~ ;@(<@(SFOPEN ,~ <@;^:(*@#));._2)&.(,&SFOPEN)@;@:isftolevel3 y do.
  NB. Convert each list of selections to a list of highlights, where a highlight is a boxed 2-row table
  NB. of top-left index,:bottom-right index.  For the last two axes only, collect contiguous indexes
  NB. into a single highlight.  For other axes, make each index a separate highlight
  NB. Before the last drop-down, there must be no multiple selection

  path =. (,: >:)@;&.>^:(-.@-:&SFOPEN)"0 path
  NB. Turn each box of the path after the dropdown into a box containing boxed tables, which can then be
  NB. catalogued and run together.  Each axis (now an axis containing one or more selections) will turn into a box
  NB. containing boxes, where each box holds a 1x2 table describing the selection.  For the last 2 axes,
  NB. the box holds (start,end+1), one for each interval; for preceding axes, it holds (sel,sel), one for each
  NB. selection.

NB. Create highlight rect for the current selection.
NB. y is the locale of the base of the inheritance chain; that's the finest highlight, so that's what we use
NB. We take all the selectors there are, up the length of the frame of this level; but if there aren't enough, we don't highlight.  Discard
NB. selectors for higher levels.  The only way we can get more selectors than frame is during sniff, where the lower
NB. selection is propagated up automatically.

NB. Create highlight rects for the operands that have been selected from this node
NB. y is a table of (selection level);(<list of ISFs)
NB. Overall result is a table of (selection level);(CSF, a single cell).
NB.
NB. Each 1{::y is a sequence of boxes: each box contains an array of boxed ISFs, where each list corresponds to one selection
NB. If the selector contains an array,
NB. each list describes one selected cell (obviously all such cells have the same rank) and the shape with respect to lists
NB. gives the shape of the selected group of cells, which may become important if subsequent selectors select from the group.
NB.
NB. We go through the sequence, appending each new selection to the previous one, leaving a sequence of increasingly long
NB. ISFs.  The interesting part comes when one of the selections has rank >1 (example: u/.).  When this is first
NB. encountered, it creates an array of ISFs.  If this array is subsequently selected from, the leading axes of the selection
NB. select from the array of rects, and any surplus is appended to the selection.
hlightforoperands =: ;@:(4 : 0&.>/"1)`(a:"0)@.(0=#)
NB. Here x is the selection level.
NB. We use axes from each new selection to take from the old selections, and then append
NB. the new selections, with those leading axes removed.  The result may have any shape, but each list is
NB. an hrect
NB. y here is a list of boxes, each containing (an array of) lists of selections.  The selections are isfs, so first

NB. Result is the joined lists (y,x), flattened so that each axis is in one box

yl2 =. , ; <^:(1=L.)"0 y
NB. There may be multiple boxes of y containing boxes with multiple values, BUT: these boxes must
NB. be trailing boxes of y.  See how many there are.  This is the number of axes of x we can index.  this is ranky
NB. We take the LEADING x axes among the eligible ones, so that successive axes go in order
NB. selrank, the number of boxes of x we can process, is limited by the number of trakiling boxes of y

NB. Convert highlight rectangle(s) to rectangles (tl,:br) unboxed (never empty)
NB. x is shape;yendpos;xendpos[;subDOLs], y is boxed CSF
NB. Each box of y is either SFOPEN or a 2-row table where the first row is the index of top-left and the
NB. bottom row is the index of bottom-right
NB. Result is table of top,left,:bottom,right
NB. We drop down through the boxing hierarchy according to the occurrences of SFOPEN
NB. It is possible that this routine will be called with an invalid rectangle: to wit, when, during sniff,
NB. we select a nonexistent output (which we keep for highlighting porposes, since the input exists).  This
NB. case manifests as surplus shape with no corresponding subDOLs.  We return INVALIDRECT then
INVALIDRECT =: 2 2 $ 0 0 _1 _1

hlighttotlbr =: (4 : 0"1 0)`((2 2$0)"0)@.(0=#@])
NB. If the data is empty, we don't have any good way to highlight it, and it will generate an error here
NB. when we ultimately try to select two axes.  So we reject it early
if. 0 e. 0 {:: x do. INVALIDRECT return. end.

NB. Normally, the selection does not exceed the size of the displayed result, since it came from a click on the display.
NB. But if there is an error, we will select further to sniff out the error, and that may leave us with
NB. undisplayable selections.  So we discard them
sel =. shapeused (<.&({:@$) {."1 ]) sel
NB. To handle <2 axes, we will add 2 leading 0 axes to the highlight selector.
NB. We compensate by adding 2 to all the axis numbers, and inserting a leading axis.
NB. If there are no axes to add to, there are 2 cases: 1 axis, which is ($0);,0: we turn that
NB. into 1;0 2 - and 0 axis, which we turn into 1;1 - repetition is OK, since the repeated axis is the
NB. added axis.  We add leading 0 (actual value immaterial) to axisshapes to match the shape
NB. Get selection for each axis, producing a 2x(1 or 2) table of indexes

NB. Calculate right profile of left block.  lss is the start/stop list, which is a table of
NB. (y,x) values: positive x means a block starts at that y-position and x-value; negative x means
NB. a block ends at that y-position-1 and |x-value.  We extend the blocks by MINBOXSPACING to leave

NB. Each y value gives the valid x until the next higher y value; so we will keep the
NB. y values in DESCENDING order and look up in that table, so that match on an interval means

This is the name field for a named noun.  In verb blocks this will be the rank stack.

)
hoverDOlabelposranktutorial =: (#~  LF&= <: (LF,LF)&E.) 0 : 0
This is the rank stack.  At the bottom of the stack is the verb whose result is displayed in the data portion of the block.  
Other lines in the rank stack are modifiers that affect the execution of the verb by changing the cells it operates on.


The numbers at the right (and also the left, for dyads) of each line indicate the rank of the cells operated on by the verb/modifier shown in that line.  
Each number is the lesser of the rank of the argument and the corresponding verb-rank.  
If this value is shown in normal font, the entire argument was a single cell of the verb and has the indicated rank.  
If this value is shown in bold italics, the argument was broken up into cells of the indicated rank, and the verb was executed on each cell separately.


A modifier is assigned a new selection level if it produces more than one result-cell.  By repeatedly clicking in the data area you can select from successive levels.


Each selection level has a color.  
This color is used for all information for the level:

(1) the rank here,

(2) the color of the frame of the modifier in the shape line, 

(3) the background color of a selected result-cell, 

(4) the outline color used to show the argument cells that contributed to the selected result.


For example, in the sentence

(i.3) +"1"2 i. 3 4 3

the rank stack for + will have 3 lines, one for each " modifier and one for the verb + .  
The top line (white), with rank 2, relates to the overall verb +"1"2 .  The middle line (green), with rank 1, relates to the verb +"1.  
The bottom line (magenta), with rank 0, relates to the verb + .  Selection is possible at each level.


Hovering over a line of the rank stack will provide more information.  
Hovering over the verb line will describe the overall operation of the block; hovering over a modifier line will describe that modifier.

This is the shape line.  
It gives the result-shape.  
If you make a selection in the data area, a second line will appear to show which cell was selected.


The result-shape is the concatenation of the frame and the shape of the result cells.  
If you ignore the coloring and simply read the numbers, that will tell you the shape of the data block.  


The frame, if any, is the part of the result-shape before the dark-blue result-cell shape.  
As you make selections in the data area, you will see the coloring of the frame change to indicate which portions of the frame were used at each selection level.


The shape of the result cells (the last component of the result-shape) is shown in white against a dark-blue background.  
If the result-cells have varying shapes, the filled shape, enclosed in parentheses, is appended to the result-shape to indicate that the result contains fills, which are shown by crosshatching in the data area.


If the block is part of a compound using @, &, or &. there is no displayable result until a single result-cell has been selected.  Until that time the shape/selection lines are omitted.

A result that is a single atom (with empty shape) is indicated by the word 'atom' in the result-cell shape.


If the block includes modifiers that look inside the boxing structure, namely each, &.>, L:n, or S:n, entry into a level of boxing is indicated with '>' at the appropriate point.

The result-shape is the concatenation of the frame and the shape of the result cells.  
If you ignore the coloring and simply read the numbers, that will tell you the shape of the data block.


Each selection level has a color.  
This color is used for all information for the level: 

(1) the rank in the rank stack, 

(2) the background color of the frame and selection here, 

(3) the background color of a selected result-cell, 

(4) the outline color used to show the argument cells that contributed to the selected result.


The frame, if any, is the part of the result-shape before the dark-blue result-cell shape.
As you make selections in the data area, you will see the coloring of the frame change to indicate which portions of the frame were used at each selection level.


The shape of the result cells (the last component of the result-shape) is shown in white against a dark-blue background.
It indicates the shape of the results of the last selection level.
If the result-cells have varying shapes, the filled shape, enclosed in parentheses, is appended to the result-shape to indicate that the result contains fills (which are shown by crosshatching in the data area).


The second line indicates the selections you have made.
Each selection selects a single result-cell; the path to that cell is shown beneath the frame that it was selected from.


If the block is part of a compound using @, &, or &. there is no displayable result until a single result-cell has been selected.  Until that time the shape/selection lines are omitted.

A result that is a single atom (with empty shape) is indicated by the word 'atom' in the result-cell shape.

erroragree
?framing
The verb completed correctly on each cell, but the result-cells are of different types and cannot be assembled into a single result.

This error is reported as 'domain error' in the J session.

The result-cells that could not be assembled are shown below, with each result inside its own dashed box, so that you can see where the incompatibility arises.
?no neutral
When (u/ y) is executed with empty y, the result is a neutral (aka identity element) for u.  But this u has no neutral.
?invalid operand
An operand to a modifier is invalid.  The derived verb was not executed.

This is reported as a 'domain error' in the J session.
?invalid verb
This combination was rejected before it was even executed on its arguments.

This is reported as a 'domain error' in the J session.
?error
This execution resulted in an error, but overall execution continued.

If this verb is being executed on a cell of fills, the error result is treated as if it were 0.

If this verb is executed in the combination u :: v, execution continues with the v side.
?incompatible selectors
In x m} y, the selectors select regions of y that have different shapes.  The selectors are the atoms of x in x { y or the atoms of m in x m} y.

This is reported as a 'domain error' in the J session.
?non-atomic v
In m@.v, the execution of v must result in a numeric atom.

This is reported as a 'domain error' in the J session.
?selection too long
In x u;.3 y, x specifies more axes than y has.

This is reported as a 'length error' in the J session.
?selector invalid
In x m} y, a complementary selector is not a single atomic box.  The selectors are the atoms of >m in x m} y.

This is reported as an 'index error' in the J session.
?selector rank
In x { y or x m} y, the selectors have rank > 1.  The selectors are >x in x { y or >m in x m} y.

This is reported as a 'rank error' in the J session
?selector level
In x { y or x m} y, a selector has boxing level higher than 3.  The selectors are the atoms of x in x { y or the atoms of m in x m} y.

This is reported as a 'domain error' in the J session.
?selector too long
In x { y or x m} y, a selector specifies more axes than y has.  The selectors are the atoms of x in x { y or the atoms of m in x m} y.

This is reported as a 'length error' in the J session.
?xm agreement
In x m} y, $x must be a suffix of $m{y.

This is reported as a 'domain error' in the J session.
?attention interrupt
You interrupted execution with JBreak.
?break
You interrupted execution with JBreak.
?domain
The arguments to this verb are invalid.
?file name
You are operating on a nonexistent device or file.
?file number
There is no file open with that number. 
?index
You are accessing outside the bounds of your array.
?interface
You have an ill-formed filename, or are making an illegal request.
?length
Your argument has a length that this verb can't handle.
?locale
You have tried to reuse a numeric locale number.
?limit
An argument exceeds an internal limit in J.
?NaN
The computation produced a non-numeric (NaN) value, represented in J by _. .
?nonce
The operation you requested is not supported yet.
?out of memory
A value was so large that the computer ran out of memory.  This is signaled when J needs more memory to store a value and the operating system refuses to supply it.
?rank
Your argument has a rank that this verb can't handle.
?security violation
You have requested heightened security, and this verb would be insecure.
?stack
You have exceeded J's generous recursion limit, probably because of an infinite recursion.
?syntax
This verb either executes an illegal sentence or attempts to return a result that is not a noun.

The usual cause is an undefined name in the definition of the verb.
?time limit
Execution took too long.  An execution time-limit has been set by (9!:33).
?value
Execution of this verb attempted to use a name that has not been assigned.
?recoverable error
This verb failed, but execution continues with the verb given by the :: conjunction.
?0 for fill result
Execution on the cell of fills for this block failed.  Execution continues here as if the execution had produced 0.
?error on fill-cell
This block is part of an execution on a cell of fills started in another block.  This block failed.  Execution continues in the block that had the fill-cell, as if the execution on the fill-cell had produced 0.

This is the data area, where the result of the verb is displayed.  
If the result contains multiple result-cells, left-clicking in the data area will select a single result-cell for further inspection.


Each selection level has a color, used for all information for the level: 

(1) the rank in the rank stack, 

(2) the background color in the shape/selection lines, 

(3) the background color of a selected result-cell here, 

(4) the outline color used to show the argument cells that contributed to the selected result.


White is the color of the topmost selection level.  Until a selection has been made, the background of the result is white.  
When you select a result-cell, that cell becomes active in the second selection level, which is green: 

 * the background of the selected cell changes color

 * the shape/selection lines show the frame of the selected level and the path to the selected cell

 * the arguments to the computation of the result are outlined with the color of the level (the y argument is a solid outline, while x is dashed) 


The most recent selection is always indicated with a heavy black outline.  
A selection in the final executing verb does not change the background color of the selected cell, but it does highlight the arguments to its computation, 
using the color of the next selection level.


To keep the display compact, the screen space allocated to the data area is limited.  
You may change the default maximum size in the Sizes menu.  
You may also resize an individual data block by dragging the resizing handles at the lower-right of the data block.  
Whenever the entire result does not fit in the data area, scrollbars are provided; in addition you can right-click in the data area to create a fullscreen explorer window that will show the result.

NB. In this default case, we are handling normal verbs, and the contributing input is simply the selector, truncated to the length
NB. of the appropriate frame.
NB. In general, each selector contains an atom/array of index lists of selected cells.  If the selector contains an array,
NB. each list describes one selected cell (obviously all such cells have the same rank) and the shape with respect to lists
NB. gives the shape of the selected group of cells, which may become important if subsequent selectors select from the group.

NB. We create one highlight entry for each highlight, by prepending all the earlier physical selections from v-nodes, and restarting when we have a u-node.
NB. Each highlight has the level at which it was added; we discard levels below the current one (since selections before that have been applied
NB. to the operands already).
NB. If, after this trimming, there is an empty box in a selection, delete the selection as invalid - it must be
NB. a u value that was filled with empties and inherited by a higher node in which the early parts are invalid (this happens only in expansion nodes)
NB. We give the highlight the level it applies to, which is one more than than the selection level it is selected from: for example,
NB. a selection at level 0 will make the selected portion of the result display in tghe color of level 1, so we make the corresponding
NB. highlight display in level 1 also.  The highlight box for the selection (most importantly, when it goes past the last selection level)

NB. y is the current selection (a: if forced)
NB. The left operand selection, which always comes from the monad operand, is always the
NB. nonnegative selection index.  The right operand comes either from the monad (if we are selecting the
NB. last execution) or the self-reference otherwise, and either way has an index one higher.
NB. There is one selection but we
NB. create a selector with 2 rows, to match the fact that we have added a reference.
NB. We must also repair selopshapes and opselout to match the modification to selection
calcphysandhighlights =: 3 : 0
NB. For the left operand, selopshapes has the shape of an item of the selop and this is correct.
NB. For the right operand, if the last result is selected, its selopshapes is the same as
NB. the left operand, with the opselout one larger.  But for the other selections,
NB. selopshapes must be taken from the previous result.
NB. If this is the forced selection, apply the default
NB. The physical selection corresponding to the user's selection.  This is used only to create the highlights; the display in the expansion,
NB. and the installation of highlights into the expansion, are done independently (using the logical selection)
NB. As it turns out, the logical and physical are the same for u/.  We also have to
NB. modify selopshapes to account for the selection
rootsel =. '' ($,) frame | {. (('';0) {:: isfensureselection isftorank2 y) , _1
NB. For operands that are loopbacks (only the second operand, and only if we are not at the last selection)

    NB. the heavy rank-lines must be kept for u.  Moreover, if an xy verb is stealth, we need to pass rank lines that it

NB. Create the initialselection only if we are ready to use it, i. e. if we have selected down to a single value to expand.
NB. We must not create an initialselection unless we are prepared to back it up with an expansion node - otherwise the

NB. Run the expansion node for u^: (as a v-type node); pass in the analysis of v.  The result is either
NB.  nothing: no expansion, no u.  display will be just u@:v

    NB. The operands for the expansion depend on the type of power.  For non-gerund, u simply takes the x and y inputs in full.

NB. **** partitions ****
NB. A partition such as u/. is represented internally as u/.S where S is an adverb locale included simply
NB. for the purpose of selecting from the result, in case the arguments have a rank that cause the partition to
NB. be executed more than once.  In the executed sentence, u saves the result of each execution of u, and /.
NB. saves all the u-results for a given partition.  S holds the results for all the partitions.
NB.
NB. S inherits the display of /. into its result.  /. creates a display for u, and also acts as a verb in
NB. displaying its own result.  An x operand of /. is brought in to the left side of the display for /., and an n
NB. operand (which must be constant) is subsumed into the verb line, which is created in /. and shows the whole
NB. partition verb, prefixed by 'Final ' if there is a selection (which would cause u to expand).
NB.
NB. The action of S is simple and does not depend on any characteristic of /. except its rank, which it find by looking
NB. inside /. .  S merely selects, if selection is possible.  It passes its argument x to /.

Inputs come in at the top of a block, the output comes out of the bottom.  Execution flows generally from top to bottom.  For blocks such as u^:v and m@.v that have a control input, the control input comes from the right.
<p>
For verbal information about the execution of a sentence, hover over it.
<h2>Display of modifiers</h2>
Each block represents the execution of a verb.  The verb may be a primitive or a named verb, or it may be a <strong>compound verb</strong>, such as u"n, u@v or u/ .
<p>
The last line in the rank stack is a verb that executes to produce a result.  Modifiers that affect the way the verb is applied to its inputs, such as "n or L:n, are shown in a line in the rank stack.
By looking at the ranks in the rank stack, and the color-coding of the shape line, you can see how the input to the verb is broken into cells.
<h2>Invisible modifiers</h2>
Sentence elements that simply control the flow of computation, such as &, @, &., ~, ], [, hook, and fork, are not shown explicitly.  Their effect is taken into account in the way the blocks are connected.
<p>
If a modifier such as "n is applied to a hook or fork, or to u&v, it is shown in the rank stack of each verb it applies to.  For example, in (* % #)"1 the "1 will be shown on the * and # blocks.
<h1>Probing Execution</h1>
To see more about how a result was computed, click on it. This will produce <strong>highlighting</strong>, <strong>selection</strong>, or <strong>expansion</strong>, if there is more to be seen.
<h2>Highlighting</h2>
Clicking on a result that has more than one result-cell will <strong>highlight</strong> that cell, and the arguments that contributed to its calculation.
The result-cell itself is highlighted with a solid black border; the arguments have dashed colored borders.  The color of the argument border matches the selection level of the result-cell.
<h2>Selection</h2>
When a result is created by more than one verb, for example +:@&gt;"1, where the result of +: is also the result of the larger verb +:@&gt; as well as the overall verb +:@&gt;"1, clicking on a result-cell <strong>selects</strong> that cell, in all the verbs that contribute to the result.
The selection chooses a cell of the largest containing verb; clicking again within the selected cell chooses a cell of the next-largest verb, and so on.
Each selected cell is color-coded with a background color that indicates its selection level.  This color matches the highlighting color for its arguments, and also the colors used in the shape and selection lines.
Hovering over the rank stack will show the verbs that selections are made from.
<h3>Hidden Results</h3>
Compound verbs using @, &, and &. operate on cells individually and may produce intermediate results that cannot be assembled into a single result.
For example, in #@&gt; 2;'a' the individual results of > are incompatible.  In such compounds, the verbs before the final result show no values until a single argument-cell has been selected.
<h3>Selection inside boxes</h3>
If the block includes modifiers that look inside the boxing structure, namely each, &.>, L:n, or S:n, selection includes opening any boxes that enclose the actual argument.  Entry into a level of boxing is indicated with '>' at the appropriate point in the selection line.
<h2>Expansion</h2>
Many modifiers, such as u;.1 y, u/ y, or u^:v y, produce many intermediate results on their way to a final result.
Clicking on a result of such a modifier will create a new block, called an <strong>expansion block</strong>.
The overall result of the modifier will be tagged as 'Final', and the expansion block will connect to its input.
Expansion blocks come in two types.
<h3>Expansion for selected results</h3>
<strong>Partitioning modifiers</strong> (u/. u\ u\. u;.) apply the verb u repeatedly, and assemble the individual result into a final overall result.  Computation is <strong>repeated</strong> but not <strong>hidden</strong>.
For these modifiers, the expansion block shows the single application of u that led to the selected result.  You can probe the expansion block to understand this result.

Other modifiers without hidden results, such as m@.v and u :: v, produce single expansion blocks similarly.
<h3>Expansion for intermediate results</h3>
The modifiers u/ and u^:v, as well as recursion $:, perform repeated calculations but show only the result of the last one.  For example, u/ 1 2 3 computes (2 u 3) and then (1 u (2 u 3)).

For these verbs, the expansion block shows all the intermediate results on the way to the final result.  Select one of these intermediate results to see how it was computed, and click further to probe its execution.

The intermediate results are shows as the contents of separate boxes.  When you select a result, the box is opened to allow further probing.  The selection of a intermediate result counts as the first level of selection for the block, and includes a '>' in the shape/selection lines to represent the opening of the selection.
<h2>Sentences containing errors</h2>
When a sentence fails, dissect will automatically select each cell in the path to the error, so that the initial display will show the failing computation.
<h2>Undo and redo</h2>
The buttons at the top of the dissect form allow you to undo and redo selections, or start over in the initial state.
<h1>Display of data</h1>
All arrays are displayed in 2-dimensional form.
<h2>Results with high rank</h2>
A 3-dimensional result is displayed as a list of 2-dimensional arrays.  A 4-dimensional result is displayed as a 2-dimensional array of 2-dimensional arrays, and so on.
Blue lines indicate boundaries between such cells, with the width of the line indicating the rank of the cells it separates.
<h2>Large results</h2>
You can select, under the Sizes menu, the maximum size of the display for a result.  If the result is larger than this maximum, it will be displayed with scrollbars.
If you right-click on a result with scrollbars, a fullscreen window, called an <strong>explorer window</strong>, will pop up providing a larger view.
Selections can be made in either the explorer window or the main dissect form.
Right-clicking in the explorer window will close it.
<h2>Constant nouns</h2>
Results that do not depend on a variable are called constants and are displayed without showing all the detail that created them.  For example, in the sentence
<p>
z + 2 2 $ _1 1 1 0
<p>
the right argument to + will be a single block containing the 2x2 array.  To see the computation that produced the constant, click on the constant's value.
<h2>Fill cells, error cells, and unexecuted cells</h2>
Crosshatching indicates atoms that were added when results of unequal sizes were filled.  Double crosshatching indicates the cell on which an error was detected.
Reverse crosshatching indicates cells that were not executed owing to earlier error.

Note  'Overview of dissect'

Operation follows this sequence:

0. Initialization of environment
1. Parsing; creation of sentences to execute and locales for analysis
2. Execute the sentence
3. Analyze the results
4. Display the picture

After the display, user interaction proceeds with
5. Selection
6. Expansion nodes
7. Highlighting
8. Hovering

0. Initialization
Each invocation of dissect runs in its own locale, which is an instance of 'dissect'.  Private names
in the user's namespace are all collected, along with their values and the sentence to be executed,
and passed into 'parsemain' for analysis.  Multiple active dissection do not interfere with each
other except for a few globals that are deemed user-specific rather than dissection-specific, font size being
an example.

1. Parsing
Parsing follows the J parsing rules.  Each word is given a locale, and given the locales of its arguments.
All such locales have COCREATOR set to the dissect instance for the sentence.  When a monad or dyad execution
in encountered, setvalence is called to select the valence for each primitive.

After parsing, the sentence is represented in the parse tree made up of the locales and their interconnections.
The entry point (defstring) creates the string form of the executed sentence (possibly omitting some assignments)
and the entry point (exestring) creates a form that includes code to save every result as created by each verb.

2. Execution
The uninstrumented and instrumented versions are both executed to make sure the results agree.
For the most part, results rather than inputs are saved, though in a few cases the inputs must also be saved to
reconstruct the operation.  The actual executed verb is saved too, so we can get its ranks.  The results are
saved in the name 'logvalues' in each primitive instance.  Each result is given a sequential
result number (called the logticket) among all the results of the sentence; the sequence of result numbers suffices to establish
the order of execution.

3. Analysis
The stored results are analyzed by a traversal through the parse tree.  This single traversal combines
top-down and bottom-up aspects.  The input to the traversal of each node is the locales of the displayed
arguments, and the selection information coming from downstream results; the result of the traversal is the
locale in which the result of the node will be displayed.

a. travdowncalcselect
The first step of traversal is to figure out which result-cell(s) have been selected for display, and which logticket
numbers correspond to inputs to those cells.  This involves looking at the user selections, the frames of the
arguments, and the ranks of the verbs.  The special details of each primitive affect this computation, but the
overall framework is in the verb (travdowncalcselect) which calls a number of sub-verbs that can be replaced in
each primitive locale as needed.  travdowncalcselect sets a couple of dozen globals that are used for calculating the
display and in specifying highlighting and selection for the arguments when they are traversed.

b. traverse components
After travdowncalcselect has figured out the results and inputs to the computation at a node, the nodes that
contribute to it are traversed.  For example, consider u@v.  u@v has its own node, at which selections are allowed.
After u@v has called travdowncalcselect, it traverses v, and then traverses u, passing in the result of v.  Each
of these traversals can apply its own selections.

c. joinlayouts
The result of the traversal is a layout, which is just the locale number of a displayable result.  Creating a layout involves
saving globals used for display (such as the rank and caption information), and saving the wiring information about how the
nodes should be connected.  The node creates its layout when it has sufficient information.

d. inheritu
Not every primitive gets a display node.  For example, hooks/forks have no display node, and in u@v there are display nodes
for u and v, but not for the composite verb; similarly for u"n.  Nevertheless the primitive IS an important entity, because it
has a rank and can be a point of selection.  Thus, the display block of u is shared between u and u@v: the first click
for selection is sent to u@v, and the next to u.  Any number of nodes can share a display block.

The verb (inheritu) is used to combine the display of u into that of u@v.  It is called by any primitive that needs
display-block sharing.

e. error autoselection
If a sentence has an error, there is an extra first traversal (without display) to find out where the error is.  If at any
point a primitive produces too few results, an error is assumed, and a selection is performed as if the user had selected
the error cell.

4. Display
At the end of traversal the final result will have a layout assigned.  At that point the display can be created.  This is
done in two passes.  First, the locales in the display are traversed, and the information to be displayed is calculated and
sized.  This establishes the screen dimensions of each node.  The nodes are then laid out on the screen so that the flow
of information goes top to bottom.

After the screen has been laid out, the wiring is inserted.  This uses a grid-based router.
The procedure takes two passes.  In each, the networks, each comprising a source
and multiple destinations, are routed one by one.  In the first pass, the routing penalizes invalid routes (where two lines
lie on top of each other in the same direction), but does not forbid them.  If the layout requires an invalid route, the
layout is expanded by adding space at the trouble point; these trial routes are repeated until a valid placement is
found.  The result of the last placement becomes the final route.

5. Selection
Each locale, representing one primitive, has a "selection level" (sellevel) and a series of "selections" (selections).  The
locale is "selectable" if it has more than one result-cell.  Left-clicking in a selectable result causes the selected cell to
be calculated, and an additional box added to the selections in its locale and all other locales that depend on the selected
locale.

Since a single display block may contain the results of multiple verbs (for example, u@v y displays the result of v in the
same block as the result of u@v), a click in a shared result must be sent to the proper verb.  The click is taken by the
verb with the lowest selection level that has not been selected yet with the same value.  Thus a click
in the result of u@v will choose a result of u@v.  A subsequent click in that same result-cell of u@v will select a result-cell
of v; but a click in a different result-cell of u@v will change the selection of u@v.

After a selection has been made, the display is retraversed and redisplayed, since it may change radicaly.

6. Expansion nodes
Complex modifiers that execute operands multiple times require additional display nodes to show the results from the different
executions of the operands.  These verbs are initially displayed giving only the overall result of the modifier; but if the
user clicks in that result, they create additional display blocks to show the intermediate calculations.  The intermediate
blocks end in an "expansion block" which allows selection among the results of the operand; blocks feeding into the
expansion block detail the innards of the operand.  When an expansion block is displayed, the overal result of the verb is
marked with the prefix "Final " to indicate the presence elsewhere of the expansion.

7. Highighting
Selection changes the color of result-cells as they are selected.  The argument-cells that
contributed to a selected result are "highlighted" with a color-coded outline box that shows which cells were used.
Highlighting is intricate, because it must pass through sequential modifiers to find the noun argument that contributed
to a result.  During the traversal, each node is given references to the locales that contain the display of the arguments.
The selection information for each argument is accumulated in the display locales.  Each modifier adds to the
selection information, giving the path to the cells selected by the modifier.  To calculate the displayed highlight,
the selections are processed in turn, starting with the map of the original noun, and creating a series of sets of
selected cells.  The cells that are selected at each selection level are then highlighted with the appropriate color.

8. Hovering
Hovering is the main method of informational interaction with the user.  Hovering over a cell results in a timer event which
figures out what cell is hovered over.  Then a complete analysis of the cell is calculated, by looking at overall information
about the display block and also primitive-specific information.  This is all collected into a set of sentences, each of which is
classified with a semantic code.  The sentences are then culled according to the user's desired tutorial level, ordered
according to a grammar that orders the semantic codes, processed to resolve internal references such as "also" and number, and
then reflowed to fit the screen size.  The result is displayed as a tooltip.
